# **WordArt**
As for my **4th** Portfolio Project with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) my intention was to build a website that would be an asset for menthal health issues as nowadays i feel like this is quite a common issue. I believe reading in general is healthy and can help and improve a lot on our mindset and emotional state. [WordArt | Quotes and Poems for the Soul](https://wordart.herokuapp.com/) was built for this exact reason.

# **Project**
## **Objective**

I love reading all kinds of things like books, short stories, poems, quotes. Reading can be a great way to relax and unwind. It can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression by providing a mental escape from daily pressures.
<br/>
The objective of this app would be to provide a user-friendly platform for users to find, share, and discuss their favorite quotes and poems, while also allowing them to connect with other like-minded individuals.
