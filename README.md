# **WordArt**
As for my **4th** Portfolio Project with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) my intention was to build a website that would be an asset for menthal health issues as nowadays i feel like this is quite a common issue. I believe reading in general is healthy and can help and improve a lot on our mindset and emotional state. [WordArt | Quotes and Poems for the Soul](https://wordart.herokuapp.com/) was built for this exact reason.

# **Project**
## **Objective**

I love reading all kinds of things like books, short stories, poems, quotes. Reading can be a great way to relax and unwind. It can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression by providing a mental escape from daily pressures.
<br/>
The objective of this app would be to provide a user-friendly platform for users to find, share, and discuss their favorite quotes and poems, while also allowing them to connect with other like-minded individuals.

### **Wireframes**

The WIREFRAMES for WordArt were created with [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/) to help visualize the project. They slightly differ from the website's final look due to developements and new ideas during creation.

* Desktop <br>

* Mobile <br>

### **Site Structure**

The WordArt website has 2 main pages when accessed by a user who is not logged in and 4 pages when the user is logged in.

* User interface:
    - About page - this is the page that welcomes the user when accessing the website
    - WordArt page - here users can find all Quotes and Poems posted on the website

* Admin dashboard:
    - The admin dashboard is only accessible by the superuser. The purpose is to manage and maintain the website content.

### **Design Choices**
* **Typography**

Kalam's letterforms feature a very steep slant from the top right to the bottom left. They are similar to letters used in everyday handwriting, and look like they might have been written with either a thin felt-tip pen, or a ball-point pen. In the Devanagari letterforms, the knotted-terminals are open, but some other counter forms are closed.

Like many informal handwriting-style fonts, it appears rather fresh and new when seen on screen or printed on the page.

I have chosen the Kalam font for the website (falls back on cursive). Choice was made due to the fonts hadnwriting effect which is complementing the website's aesthetics..

* **Colour Scheme**

The colour scheme choice was somewhat based on the main page's hero image keeping a common attribute throughout the whole website.

The color scheme visualisation was made using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

### **Project Management**

Throughout the building of this project i have used GitHub project board to manage the workflow. This tool helped me organize and prioritize my work. With GitHub project board, I was able to create a visual representation of the project's tasks, workflows, and progress.

GitHub project board was divided into three columns: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". I have created issues within github for each user story and added labels to each to indicate the priority and status of the task.

GitHub project board helped me to:
* keep track of my progress and stay on track with the deadlines.
* prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency.
* easily move tasks between columns as they were completed

Overall, using GitHub project board helped me to stay organized and focused throughout the project.
